In that instance I could feel no doubt of man's oneness with the universe. The conviction came that that rhythm was too orderly, too harmonious, too perfect to be a product of blind chance - that, therefore, there must be a purpose in the whole and that man was part of that whole and not an accidental off-shoot. It was a feeling that transcended reason; that went to the heart of man's despair and found it groundless. The universe was a cosmos, not a chaos; man was as rightfully a part of that cosmos as were the day and night. - Admiral Bird, 1934 on trip to Antarctic<br clear="none"></p></div><div>"My goal is to build a life I don't need a vacation from." - Rob Hill Sr.<br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>"My feet is my only carriage, so I've got to push on through." - Robert Nesta Marley<br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>They tried to bury us, they didn't know we were seeds.&nbsp; <br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>Row, row, row your boat<br clear="none"> Gently down the stream,<br clear="none"> Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily<br clear="none"> Life is but a dream ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫<br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div><div><p>A wise friend once told me, the more you think about things you cannot control, the more you are allowing that person, event, or experience to have control and power over you.
