                The tao that can be told<br>
                is not the eternal Tao<br>
                The name that can be named<br>
                is not the eternal Name.<br>
                <br>
                The unnamable is the eternally real.<br>
                Naming is the origin<br>
                of all particular things.<br>
                <br>
                Free from desire, you realize the mystery.<br>
                Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.<br>
                <br>
                Yet mystery and manifestations<br>
                arise from the same source.<br>
                This source is called darkness.<br>
                <br>
                Darkness within darkness.<br>
                The gateway to all understanding.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                When people see some things as beautiful,<br>
                other things become ugly.<br>
                When people see some things as good,<br>
                other things become bad.<br>
                <br>
                Being and non-being create each other.<br>
                Difficult and easy support each other.<br>
                Long and short define each other.<br>
                High and low depend on each other.<br>
                Before and after follow each other.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore the Master<br>
                acts without doing anything<br>
                and teaches without saying anything.<br>
                Things arise and she lets them come;<br>
                things disappear and she lets them go.<br>
                She has but doesn't possess,<br>
                acts but doesn't expect.<br>
                When her work is done, she forgets it.<br>
                That is why it lasts forever.<br>

                If you overesteem great men,<br>
                people become powerless.<br>
                If you overvalue possessions,<br>
                people begin to steal.<br>
                <br>
                The Master leads<br>
                by emptying people's minds<br>
                and filling their cores,<br>
                by weakening their ambition<br>
                and toughening their resolve.<br>
                He helps people lose everything<br>
                they know, everything they desire,<br>
                and creates confusion<br>
                in those who think that they know.<br>
                <br>
                Practice not-doing,<br>

                The Tao is like a well:<br>
                used but never used up.<br>
                It is like the eternal void:<br>
                filled with infinite possibilities.<br>
                <br>
                It is hidden but always present.<br>
                I don't know who gave birth to it.<br>
                It is older than God.<br>

            <p>
                The Tao doesn't take sides;<br>
                it gives birth to both good and evil.<br>
                The Master doesn't take sides;<br>
                she welcomes both saints and sinners.<br>
                <br>
                The Tao is like a bellows:<br>
                it is empty yet infinitely capable.<br>
                The more you use it, the more it produces;<br>
                the more you talk of it, the less you understand.<br>
                <br>
                Hold on to the center.<br>

                The Tao is called the Great Mother:<br>
                empty yet inexhaustible,<br>
                it gives birth to infinite worlds.<br>
                <br>
                It is always present within you.<br>

            <p>
                The Tao is infinite, eternal.<br>
                Why is it eternal?<br>
                It was never born;<br>
                thus it can never die.<br>
                Why is it infinite?<br>
                It has no desires for itself;<br>
                thus it is present for all beings.<br>
                <br>
                The Master stays behind;<br>
                that is why she is ahead.<br>
                She is detached from all things;<br>
                that is why she is one with them.<br>
                Because she has let go of herself,<br>
                she is perfectly fulfilled.<br>

                The supreme good is like water,<br>

                Thus it is like the Tao.<br>
                <br>
                In dwelling, live close to the ground.<br>
                In thinking, keep to the simple.<br>
                In conflict, be fair and generous.<br>
                In governing, don't try to control.<br>
                In work, do what you enjoy.<br>
                In family life, be completely present.<br>
                <br>
                When you are content to be simply yourself<br>
                and don't compare or compete,<br>
                everybody will respect you.<br>

                Each separate being in the universe<br>
                returns to the common source.<br>
                Returning to the source is serenity.<br>
                <br>
                If you don't realize the source,<br>
                you stumble in confusion and sorrow.<br>
                When you realize where you come from,<br>
                you naturally become tolerant,<br>
                disinterested, amused,<br>
                kindhearted as a grandmother,<br>
                dignified as a king.<br>
                Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,<br>
                you can deal with whatever life brings you,<br>
                and when death comes, you are ready.<br>

                She lets them go their own way,<br>
                and resides at the center of the circle.<br>

                doesn't try to force issues<br>

                always rebounds upon oneself.<br>
                <br>
                The Master does his job<br>
                and then stops.<br>
                He understands that the universe<br>
                is forever out of control,<br>
                and that trying to dominate events<br>
                goes against the current of the Tao.<br>
                Because he believes in himself,<br>
                he doesn't try to convince others.<br>
                Because he is content with himself,<br>
                he doesn't need others' approval.<br>
                Because he accepts himself,<br>
                the whole world accepts him.<br>

                Governing a large country<br>
                is like frying a small fish.<br>
                You spoil it with too much poking.<br>
                <br>
                Center your country in the Tao<br>
                and evil will have no power.<br>
                Not that it isn't there,<br>
                but you'll be able to step out of its way.<br>
                <br>
                Give evil nothing to oppose<br>
                and it will disappear by itself.<br>

                When a country obtains great power,<br>
                it becomes like the sea:<br>
                all streams run downward into it.<br>
                The more powerful it grows,<br>
                the greater the need for humility.<br>
                Humility means trusting the Tao,<br>
                thus never needing to be defensive.<br>
                <br>
                A great nation is like a great man:<br>
                When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.<br>
                Having realized it, he admits it.<br>
                Having admitted it, he corrects it.<br>
                He considers those who point out his faults<br>
                as his most benevolent teachers.<br>
                He thinks of his enemy<br>
                as the shadow that he himself casts.<br>
                <br>
                If a nation is centered in the Tao,<br>
                if it nourishes its own people<br>
                and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,<br>
                it will be a light to all nations in the world.<br>

                The Tao is the center of the universe,<br>
                the good man's treasure,<br>
                the bad man's refuge.<br>
                <br>
                Honors can be bought with fine words,<br>
                respect can be won with good deeds;<br>
                but the Tao is beyond all value,<br>
                and no one can achieve it.<br>
                <br>
                Thus, when a new leader is chosen,<br>
                don't offer to help him<br>
                with your wealth or your expertise.<br>
                Offer instead<br>
                to teach him about the Tao.<br>
                <br>
                Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?<br>
                Because, being one with the Tao,<br>
                when you seek, you find;<br>
                and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.<br>

                The Master never reaches for the great;<br>

                When she runs into a difficulty,<br>
                she stops and gives herself to it.<br>

                What he desires is non-desire;<br>
                what he learns is to unlearn.<br>
                He simply reminds people<br>

                He cares about nothing but the Tao.<br>

                people lose their spirit.<br>

                Act for the people's benefit.<br>

                Men are born soft and supple;<br>
                dead, they are stiff and hard.<br>
                Plats are born tender and pliant;<br>
                dead, they are brittle and dry.<br>
                <br>
                Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible<br>
                is a disciple of death.<br>
                Whoever is soft and yielding<br>
                is a disciple of life.<br>
                <br>
                The hard and stiff will be broken.<br>
                The soft and supple will prevail.<br>

            <p>
                As it acts in the world, the Tao<br>
                is like the bending of a bow.<br>
                The top is bent downward;<br>
                the bottom is bent up.<br>
                It adjusts excess and deficiency<br>
                so that there is perfect balance.<br>
                It takes from what is too much<br>
                and give to what isn't enough.<br>
                <br>
                Those who try to control,<br>
                who use force to protect their power,<br>
                go against the direction of the Tao.<br>
                They take from those who don't have enough<br>
                and give to those who have far too much.<br>
                <br>
                The Master can keep giving<br>
                because there is no end to her wealth.<br>
                She acts without expectation,<br>
                succeeds without taking credit,<br>
                and doesn't think that she is better<br>
                than anyone else.<br>

            <p>
                Nothing in the world<br>
                is as soft and yielding as water.<br>
                Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,<br>
                nothing can surpass it.<br>
                <br>
                The soft overcomes the hard;<br>
                the gentle overcomes the rigid.<br>
                Everyone knows this is true,<br>
                but few can put it into practice.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore the Master remains<br>
                serene in the midst of sorrow.<br>
                Evil cannot enter his heart.<br>
                Because he has given up helping,<br>
                he is people's greatest help.<br>
                <br>
                True words seem paradoxical.<br>

                there is no end to the blame.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore the Master<br>
                fulfills her own obligations<br>
                and corrects her own mistakes.<br>
                She does what she needs to do<br>
                and demands nothing of others.<br>

                If a country is governed wisely,<br>
                its inhabitants will be content.<br>
                They enjoy the labor of their hands<br>
                and don't waste time inventing<br>
                labor-saving machines.<br>
                Since they dearly love their homes,<br>
                they aren't interested in travel.<br>
                There may be a few wagons and boats,<br>

                There may be an arsenal of weapons,<br>
                but nobody ever uses them.<br>
                People enjoy their food,<br>
                take pleasure in being with their families,<br>
                spend weekends working in their gardens,<br>
                delight in the doings of the neighborhood.<br>
                And even though the next country is so close<br>
                that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,<br>
                they are content to die of old age<br>
                without ever having gone to see it.<br>

                True words aren't eloquent;<br>
                eloquent words aren't true.<br>
                Wise men don't need to prove their point;<br>
                men who need to prove their point aren't wise.<br>

                The Master has no possessions.<br>
